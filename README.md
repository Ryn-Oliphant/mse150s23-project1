I learned more about np.loadtxt, such as comments, which makes this function
an easier way to manage data than I previously thought. I also learned how to
run python code using the command line. I didn't have any frequent problems
since I have experience with debugging and after a few attempts I will just
Google whatever error I am getting. The only problem I kind of struggled with
was initially running the code on the command line. I had pasted raw-data
instead of the correct filename, raw_data.
